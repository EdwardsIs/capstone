Overview
----------------
This is my capstone project, a Spring Boot RESTful application with jQuery on the front-end.  The very light, simple
in-memory database, H2, was used for simplicity of deployment.  As it stands, the entire project, front to back, can be 
deployed in a single Maven built .jar file.  The project also uses JBDC to interface with H2.

Files
-----------------
The files are a standard eclipse project, with the build files located under the target directory, and the code
under src.
